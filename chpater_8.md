Going Public Process

Registration with the SEC:

Companies file a registration statement disclosing financial information and business details.
Protects investors by ensuring informed investment decisions.
Underwriting Timeline:

Pre-Registration (Quiet Period):
Hire an investment bank (underwriter) to prepare the registration statement and distribute the new securities.
No public marketing or discussions allowed.
Cooling-Off Period (Waiting Period):
Registration statement filed with the SEC and becomes available to the public.
SEC reviews the statement and provides feedback.
Underwriter markets the securities using a preliminary prospectus (red herring).
Orders cannot be accepted yet.
Post-Effective Period:
SEC approves the registration statement (effective date).
Underwriter confirms orders and sells the new securities.
Final prospectus delivered to investors.
Types of Offerings:

A research analyst who works for an underwriter of an IPO must not discuss or write a research report about the company for 10 days after the IPO.  This 10-day period of silence is called a ‘quiet period.’ There is no quiet period for EGCs (emerging growth companies).

IPO vs. Follow-on:
IPO: First time a company sells its securities to the public.
Follow-on: Subsequent offerings by a public company.
Primary vs. Secondary vs. Split Offering:
Primary: Company raises capital by selling new shares.
Secondary: Existing shareholders sell their shares (founders, VCs).
Split: A combination of primary and secondary offerings.
Underwriting Syndicates:

Investment banks form a syndicate to share the risks and workload.
Bookrunner/Lead Manager: Manages the deal and takes the lead role.
Syndicate Members: Committed to buying and selling the shares.
Selling Group: Assists with distribution but not financially committed.
Commitment Types:
Firm Commitment: Underwriters buy the shares and resell them.
Best Efforts: Underwriters try to sell the shares but not guaranteed.
Stabilization (Underwriting Risk): Underwriters may buy shares to prevent a price decline after the IPO.
Shelf Registrations:

Public companies can file a registration statement for future offerings (up to 3 years).
Allows faster access to capital markets by updating the existing statement instead of filing a new one.
Only for follow-on offerings, not IPOs.
Who Can Buy IPO Shares?

FINRA and SEC restrict certain people from buying IPO shares to ensure wider distribution to the public.
Restricted Persons:
Broker-dealer firms
Broker-dealer employees
Immediate family members of broker-dealer employees
Key Takeaways:

Understand the IPO process and its different stages.
Know the roles of underwriters and different underwriting arrangements.
Be familiar with the types of offerings and who can participate in them.
Recognize the purpose of shelf registrations and their limitations.

**Tender Offers**

Oversubscription: If a tender offer is oversubscribed, shares will be accepted proportionately from those shareholders who tendered their shares. In this question, the offer was oversubscribed by a multiple of ten, thus 10

The offer is sent to each share holder and can choose to practiapte or not 
A tender offer is different than most types of business combinations (e.g., mergers and acquisitions) in that it is an offer made to each shareholder.

Both a Regulation D, Rule 506(b) and a Regulation D, Rule 506(c) offering have restrictions on potential investors.  A Regulation 506(b) offering is open no more than 35 non-accredited investors, while a Regulation 506(c) offering is only open to accredited investors.  On the other hand, a Regulation D, Rule 504 offering is open to all investors; however, this type of offering can have a total aggregate value of no more than $10 million.  Neither type of Rule 506 offering come with an aggregate offering limit.   

A research analyst who works for an underwriter of an IPO must not discuss or write a research report about the company for 10 days after the IPO.  This 10-day period of silence is called a ‘quiet period.’ There is no quiet period for EGCs (emerging growth companies).


A hedge fund is a fund that tries to achieve a positive return for its investors, even when market returns are negative. Hedge funds are similar to mutual funds in that they pool investors' money and invest it in securities, but they usually try to avoid classification as an investment companies so that they are not subject to the restrictions placed on investment companies. Hedge funds avoid being called mutual funds by meeting one of two exemptions: 

• Limit the number of investors to 100, of which up to 35 may be non-accredited, but the rest must be accredited investors.

• Sell to only qualified purchasers. Qualified purchasers are individuals with at least $5 million in investments and institutions with at least $25 million in investments.

As long as their assets under management are under $150 million, hedge funds are exempt from SEC registration; however, all hedge funds are still subject to antifraud provisions of securities laws.

**shelf registration** 
 shelf registration is when an issuer files one registration statement for a large number of securities and does not sell them immediately. Instead, the issuer puts the securities “on a shelf” and brings them down to sell when the market is favorable.
In most public offerings, an issuer will register and issue a specified number of securities and will attempt to sell all the securities in one day. If an issuer has issued securities previously and is a large enough company, it may file what is called a shelf registration (shelf offering). A

A shelf registration is good for up to three years, meaning that sales of the securities can be postponed for up to three years before having to file a new registration statement.
