Churning: This is the illegal and unethical practice of a broker excessively buying and selling securities in a client's account to generate commissions for themselves, regardless of the client's investment goals or needs. It's a serious offense, and retired reps who are still registered with a broker-dealer can be sanctioned or even lose their licenses.

Front Running: This involves a broker placing their own trades ahead of client orders, benefiting from the price movement caused by the client's larger transaction. This takes advantage of non-public information and is strictly prohibited. Retired reps who maintain access to such information (through former employer relationships for example) would be violating regulations by front running.

Commingling: This refers to mixing client funds with the broker's own money or the firm's money. Client funds must be segregated in separate accounts to protect them. Commingling can be a sign of potential misuse of funds and is a major red flag.

Gun jumping refers to actions taken by companies or individuals that violate securities laws by prematurely sharing information or engaging in activities before a regulatory period or requirement has been met. There are two main contexts where gun jumping is commonly discussed: antitrust laws and securities laws.


 Misappropriation occurs when persons steal information from their employer and trade on that information in any stock, not just their employer's stock. The misappropriation theory broadens the liability for misuse of inside information and is illegal.
