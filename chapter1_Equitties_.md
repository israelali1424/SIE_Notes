Characteristics of Common Stock

Common stock represents ownership in a company. As an owner, investors seek returns through dividends (distributions of company earnings) or through capital gains (increase in stock value).
Common stockholders have limited liability (can only lose amount invested).
Common stockholders can review financial reports like 10-Ks, 10-Qs, and annual reports.
Returns through dividends are paid out at regular intervals, often quarterly.
Capital gains/losses are the difference between the purchase price (basis) and sale price (proceeds).
Common stockholders can vote on board of directors and corporate events like mergers. They do not vote on management or dividend distributions.
Shareholder Voting

Shareholders elect the board of directors, who then appoint management.
Shareholders are informed about votes through a proxy statement which allows them to submit votes remotely.
With cumulative voting, shareholders can allocate their votes however they want when electing directors. This gives small shareholders more power.
Equity Classifications

Income stocks - Mature, pay dividends. Lower risk.
Growth stocks - Reinvest earnings to expand. Higher risk. Often tech/biotech. Seek capital gains.
Defensive stocks - Remain stable regardless of economic conditions. Lower risk.
Cyclical stocks - Follow the overall economy. Higher risk.
Equity Risks

Systematic/Market risk - Overall market downturn drags down stock price. Can hedge with options.
Business/Specific risk - Risk of loss based on issues with the specific company invested in. Mitigate through diversification.
Common Stock Priority

Common stockholders have the lowest priority for repayment in bankruptcy. Paid only after debt holders, preferred stock, etc.
Here are detailed notes on the additional key points from the lecture on other types of equity securities:

**American Depositary Receipts (ADRs)**

- Allow US investors to trade foreign stocks domestically.

- Foreign company deposits shares with US bank, who then issues ADRs to US investors.

- ADR price mirrors performance of underlying foreign shares.

- Dividends paid in foreign currency are converted to US dollars by bank.

- ADR holders face political risk, currency risk, and inflation risk but not call risk.

**Preferred Stock**

- Provides regular, steady income through fixed dividends.

- Dividends must be paid before common stock dividends.

- Preferred stock does **not** have voting rights.

**Common vs. Preferred Stock**

- Right to vote: Common

- Fixed dividends: Preferred

- Higher appreciation potential: Common

- Cumulative dividends: Preferred

- Residual assets/earnings: Common

**Penny Stocks**

- Less than $5 per share, traded over-the-counter (unlisted).

- Speculative, illiquid, volatile, fraud risk.

- Penny stocks have voting rights as common stock.

**Rights and Warrants**

- **Rights** - Allow shareholders to buy additional shares at a discount to avoid dilution. Short-term.

- **Warrants** - Allow holder to buy stock at a set price in the future. Long-term. Value depends on share price. Can be sold without exercising.

Here are detailed notes on the additional key points from the lecture on dividends, short sales, and other equity topics:

**Dividends**

- Declaration Date: Board announces dividend

- Ex-Date: First date stock trades without dividend

- Record Date: Must own stock to receive dividend

- Payment Date: Dividend distributed

- Regular way settlement is T+2 so must buy before ex-date to receive dividend

- Cash dividends are taxable events even if reinvested

**Stock Splits**

- Adjusts price and shares outstanding, does not affect value

- Price per share decreases, number of shares increases proportionately

- Reverse split decreases number of shares, increases price per share

- Splits and stock dividends are not taxable events

**Short Sales**

- Selling stock you don't own, bearish view

- Borrow shares from lender to deliver to buyer

- If stock declines, profit on repurchasing at lower price to return shares

- If stock increases, loss on repurchasing at higher price

- Maximum theoretical loss is unlimited
  Here is some additional explanation on T+1, T+2, T+0 settlement in securities trading:

- T+1, T+2 etc refers to the settlement period between the trade date (T) and the settlement date.

- T+2 is regular way settlement - the standard timeframe where a trade settles 2 business days after the trade date. This is the default settlement period.

- T+1 is one day settlement - the trade settles the next business day after the trade date.

- T+0 is same day settlement, also known as cash settlement. The trade settles on the same day as the trade date.

- The settlement period refers to the time it takes to transfer ownership of the securities from seller to buyer and make the payment. Historically this took 5 days (T+5) but has shortened over time as records became electronic.

- On the trade date (T), the price and terms are agreed but no securities/cash change hands. On the settlement date, ownership officially transfers and payment is made.

- The settlement period is important for things like receiving dividends. To receive a dividend, shares must be purchased before the ex-date so ownership transfers before the record date.

- Exchanges/parties can agree to shorten the settlement period from regular way T+2 to T+1 or T+0 if desired, through a process called "closing settlement early."

In summary, the T+1, T+2, T+0 notation refers to the timeline between trade execution and settlement and impacts issues like dividend capture and voting rights transfer. The regular way settlement period is currently T+2.

American Depository Receipts (ADRs) are receipts issued by U.S. banks, with each ADR representing one or more shares of foreign stock. ADRs are denominated in dollars and make it possible for U.S. investors to invest in foreign companies through domestic (U.S.) markets, without currency transaction costs.

As of May 28th 2024
Stock settle T+1
For regular way trades in equities, the ex-dividend date is the record date. As of May 28, 2024, the standard settlement cycle for securities transactions will be shortened from two business days after the trade (T+2) to one business day after the trade (T+1). For more information on the new rule and its implications, please refer to the “T+1 Settlement Addendum” in the supplements section of the Knopman.com Training Center.


Authorized shares are what the corporation has listed in its articles of incorporation. Authorized shares is a big, somewhat arbitrary number reflecting what could be issued, not what has been issued. The portion of authorized stock that has been sold to to shareholders is called issued stock. Treasury stock represents shares of issued stock that have been repurchased by the company and removed from public circulation. Treasury stock is treated as though it is still in the hands of the shareholder, in this case the corporation, hence it is still considered issued stock, however it has no voting rights and pays no dividends. When treasury stock is withdrawn from issued stock, the amount of stock remaining in circulation is the number of shares outstanding. Shares outstanding represents all shares in circulation and it is this number that is used to determine market capitalization and earnings per share.
