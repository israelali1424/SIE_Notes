Leading Indicators
**Definition**: Economic indicators that signal future events. They are used to predict the direction of the economy or market before the change becomes evident in the actual data.

**Examples**:
1. **Stock Market Returns**: Often seen as a predictor of economic performance because stock prices reflect investors' expectations for the future.
2. **Building Permits**: An increase in building permits suggests future construction activity and economic growth.
3. **Consumer Confidence Index**: Measures the level of confidence consumers have in the economy, which can predict future spending and economic activity.
4. **Manufacturers' New Orders**: An increase in new orders for goods suggests future production increases.
5. **Money Supply**
6. **Housing strats**

### Lagging Indicators
**Definition**: Economic indicators that follow an event. They are used to confirm trends and patterns in the economy or market after the changes have occurred.

**Examples**:

2. **Gross Domestic Product (GDP)**: Measures the total economic output after a period has ended.
3. **Corporate Profits**: Reported after the fact, indicating how companies have performed.
4. **Consumer Price Index (CPI)**: Shows changes in price levels after they have occurred, reflecting inflation or deflation.

### Coincident Indicators

**Examples**:
1. **Industrial Production**: Reflects the current level of industrial output, indicating the present state of the economy.
2. **Personal Income**: Measures the total income received by individuals, reflecting the current economic conditions.
