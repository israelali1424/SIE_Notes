**Bid vs. Ask: Customer and Other Party**

**1. Bid:**
 - **Other Party Perspective:**
     - For market makers, brokers, or sellers, the bid represents the price at which they are willing to sell the security.
     - It's the price at which the other party is willing to execute a sell order for the security.
   - **Customer Perspective:**
     - The bid represents the maximum price that a customer is willing to pay to buy a security.
     - Customers place bid orders when they want to purchase a security at a specific price or lower.
     - It reflects the demand side of the market from the customer's viewpoint.
  

**2. Ask:**
 - **Other Party Perspective:**
     - For market makers, brokers, or buyers, the ask represents the price at which they are willing to buy the security.
     - It's the price at which the other party is willing to execute a buy order for the security.
   - **Customer Perspective:**
     - The ask represents the minimum price that a customer is willing to accept to sell a security.
     - Customers place ask orders when they want to sell a security at a specific price or higher.
     - It reflects the supply side of the market from the customer's viewpoint.
  

**3. Relationship:**
   - The bid and ask create the bid-ask spread, which is the difference between the highest price a buyer is willing to pay (bid) and the lowest price a seller is willing to accept (ask).
   - The bid-ask spread reflects the liquidity and transaction costs associated with trading a security.
   - A narrow bid-ask spread indicates a liquid market with lower transaction costs, while a wide spread suggests less liquidity and potentially higher costs.

**4. Market Dynamics:**
   - Fluctuations in the bid and ask prices are influenced by various factors such as supply and demand dynamics, market sentiment, economic conditions, and investor behavior.
   - Changes in bid and ask prices reflect shifts in market conditions and participants' perceptions of the security's value.

In summary, the bid represents the buying price from the customer's perspective and the selling price from the other party's perspective, while the ask represents the selling price from the customer's perspective and the buying price from the other party's perspective.
