Interpositioning is a trading practice that involves placing a third-party broker between a broker-dealer and the best available market price, resulting in an unnecessary transaction that benefits the third party but not the customer. This practice is generally considered unethical and is prohibited under securities regulations because it can result in higher costs and worse execution prices for the customer.

Rule 147 was implemented in 1974 to provide an exemption from registration for issuers doing business within a single state, and offering and selling securities only to residents of that same  state.   The recent updates reflect  modern business practices and current communications technology.

Effective April 20, 2017, issuers need to meet only one requirement of the four below to be considered doing business in a state:

Derive at least 80% of its gross revenues from the operation of a business or of real property located in or from the state or territory;
At least 80% of its consolidated assets are located within the state or territory;
Uses at least 80% of the net proceeds from sales within the state or territory; or
A majority of the issuer’s employees are based in the state or territory.
There is also a significant change to the resale limitation of the rule.  Instead of a 9-month limitation on resale, the amendments to the rule shorten the period to a 6-month period, triggered by the date of purchase by each purchaser. Issuers are required to have a “reasonable belief” that purchases are residents of the state, and purchasers must verify their residency in writing.
