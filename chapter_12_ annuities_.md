Here are the detailed notes on annuities:

**Annuities - Contract Between**:
- Annuitant (Individual Investor)
- Life Insurance Company (Issuer)

**Key Feature**: Life insurance company promises to pay annuitant retirement income for life, addressing longevity risk.

**Types of Annuities**:
1. Fixed Annuity 
    - Return guaranteed at fixed rate by insurance company
    - Risks: Insurer insolvency, purchasing power/inflation risk
    - Premiums invested in insurer's general account

2. Variable Annuity 
    - Return varies based on investments chosen by owner from sub-accounts
    - It is a security, requires securities & insurance license to sell
    - Owner bears market risk based on investments 
    - Premiums invested in insurer's separate account

**Variable Annuity Lifecycle**:
1. Accumulation Period
    - Money goes into annuity, invested in separate account
    - Tax-deferred growth like retirement accounts
    - Can make lump sum or periodic investments
    - Value grows over time based on investments

2. Annuitization 
    - At 59.5+ years old, can annuitize to start distributions
    - Accumulation units converted to fixed annuity units
    - Number fixed, but value fluctuates based on market

3. Annuitization Period
    - Receive payments from annuity units' value
    - Payments last as long as annuitant lives
    
**Payout Options at Annuitization**:
1. Life Annuity - Payments until death
2. Period Certain - Guaranteed payments for set period (e.g. 10 years)
3. Joint & Survivor - Payments until both annuitant & spouse die

**Other Key Points**:
- Surrender charges decline annually if withdrawing before annuitization
- 1035 Exchange allows tax-free transfer between annuity contracts
- Highest payments for life annuity, lowest for joint & survivor annuity

Variable annuities are designed for long-term growth and offer numerous investment choices to align with investor objectives. Their growth is not currently taxable, which helps them accumulate strong values. Although many offer liquidity provisions that allow withdrawals of a certain percentage of the account value each year (often 10%), there are surrender charges associated with larger or more frequent withdrawals, so they do not provide substantial liquidity.

# Variable Annuities

## Fixed vs Variable Annuities

### Fixed Annuities
- Not securities
- Insurance company assumes investment risk
- Guaranteed income stream
- Investments made in insurance company's general account

### Variable Annuities
- Securities product
- Investor assumes investment risk
- Investments made in separate account (mutual fund)
- No guaranteed return

## Key Characteristics of Variable Annuities
- Mutual fund with an insurance wrapper
- Requires both securities and insurance registrations to sell
- Higher expense structure due to insurance + mutual fund components
- Tax-deferred growth

## Types of Annuities
### Tax Deferred Annuity (TDA)
- Available to anyone
- Funded with after-tax money (non-qualified)
- Has a cost basis

### Tax Sheltered Annuity (TSA)
- Only for employees of 403(b) educational institutions or 501(c) charitable organizations
- Funded with pre-tax money (qualified)
- No cost basis

## Funding and Payout
- Accumulation phase: Buy accumulation units
- Payout phase: Convert to annuity units
- Payout options affect monthly payment amount (e.g., life-only provides largest payment)

## Assumed Interest Rate (AIR)
- Benchmark for determining monthly payment changes
- If actual return > AIR, payment increases
- If actual return < AIR, payment decreases
- If actual return = AIR, payment stays the same

## Taxation
- Non-qualified annuities: Only gains are taxed (LIFO basis)
- Qualified annuities: Entire distribution is taxable
- 10% penalty for withdrawals before age 59Â½
- Ordinary income tax rates apply to distributions

## Suitability
- Generally recommended after maxing out other retirement plans
- Must consider customer's financial situation and goals
- Explain all features, including surrender charges and investment risk
- Often requires additional compliance review

## Death Benefits
- If annuitant dies during accumulation phase, included in estate value
- Beneficiary pays income tax on gains above cost basis

Remember: Variable annuities are complex products with both insurance and investment components. Understanding their features and tax implications is crucial for both exam success and real-world application.
