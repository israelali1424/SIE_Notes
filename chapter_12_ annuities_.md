Here are the detailed notes on annuities:

**Annuities - Contract Between**:
- Annuitant (Individual Investor)
- Life Insurance Company (Issuer)

**Key Feature**: Life insurance company promises to pay annuitant retirement income for life, addressing longevity risk.

**Types of Annuities**:
1. Fixed Annuity 
    - Return guaranteed at fixed rate by insurance company
    - Risks: Insurer insolvency, purchasing power/inflation risk
    - Premiums invested in insurer's general account

2. Variable Annuity 
    - Return varies based on investments chosen by owner from sub-accounts
    - It is a security, requires securities & insurance license to sell
    - Owner bears market risk based on investments 
    - Premiums invested in insurer's separate account

**Variable Annuity Lifecycle**:
1. Accumulation Period
    - Money goes into annuity, invested in separate account
    - Tax-deferred growth like retirement accounts
    - Can make lump sum or periodic investments
    - Value grows over time based on investments

2. Annuitization 
    - At 59.5+ years old, can annuitize to start distributions
    - Accumulation units converted to fixed annuity units
    - Number fixed, but value fluctuates based on market

3. Annuitization Period
    - Receive payments from annuity units' value
    - Payments last as long as annuitant lives
    
**Payout Options at Annuitization**:
1. Life Annuity - Payments until death
2. Period Certain - Guaranteed payments for set period (e.g. 10 years)
3. Joint & Survivor - Payments until both annuitant & spouse die

**Other Key Points**:
- Surrender charges decline annually if withdrawing before annuitization
- 1035 Exchange allows tax-free transfer between annuity contracts
- Highest payments for life annuity, lowest for joint & survivor annuity

Variable annuities are designed for long-term growth and offer numerous investment choices to align with investor objectives. Their growth is not currently taxable, which helps them accumulate strong values. Although many offer liquidity provisions that allow withdrawals of a certain percentage of the account value each year (often 10%), there are surrender charges associated with larger or more frequent withdrawals, so they do not provide substantial liquidity.
