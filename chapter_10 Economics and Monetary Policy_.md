### **Business Cycle**

- Four phases:

  - Expansion: Economic growth, low unemployment.
  - Peak: Economy at its highest point.
  - Contraction/Recession: GDP decline, high unemployment.
  - Trough: Low point before recovery.

### **Inflation**

- Deflation: Cost of goods and services goes down.
- In deflation, outstanding bonds have higher coupons than new bonds due to potential interest rate reduction.

### **Yield Curve**

- Graphs interest rates vs. time to maturity.

- Normal: Upward slope, longer maturity = higher yield (riskier).

- Inverted: Short-term yields higher than long-term, indicates potential recession (investors seek safety in long-term treasuries).

### **Interest Rate Sensitivity**

- Growth stocks: Less sensitive, reinvest profits for future growth.

- Dividend-paying stocks: More sensitive, value competes with bond yields (utilities, REITs, preferreds).

### **Economic Policy Theories**

- Classical (Adam Smith): Minimal government intervention.

- Keynesian: Uses government spending/tax policy to influence economy.

- Monetarist (Federal Reserve): Uses money supply to affect economy.

### **Federal Reserve Tools**

- **Open market operations:** Buying/selling treasuries to inject/extract cash.

- **Reserve requirements:** Amount of cash banks must hold in reserve.

- **Discount rate:** Rate banks borrow from the Fed.

### **Interest Rates (low to high)**

- Fed funds rate (overnight bank-to-bank loans).

- Discount rate.

- Broker call rate (margin loans).

- Prime rate (best corporate customers).

### **Economic Cycle and Stocks**

- Cyclical stocks (auto, tech) perform well in expansions.

- Defensive stocks (utilities, consumer staples, healthcare) perform better in recessions.

- Recession: Two consecutive quarters of negative GDP growth.

### **Fiscal vs. Monetary Policy**
## Fiscal Policy:
- **Definition:** Involves government decisions regarding spending and taxation.
- **Components:** 
  - *Government Spending:* Allocation of funds towards various sectors like infrastructure, healthcare, education, etc.
  - *Taxation:* Determination of taxes levied on individuals and businesses.
- **Purpose:** To influence the economy by managing aggregate demand, employment levels, and economic growth.
- **Impact:** 
  - Increased government spending can stimulate demand and economic activity.
  - Tax cuts can incentivize spending and investment.
  - Conversely, tax hikes and reduced spending can curb inflationary pressures or reduce deficits.

## Monetary Policy:

- **Definition:** Involves managing the money supply and interest rates by a central bank.
- **Components:** 
  - *Money Supply:* Regulating the amount of money circulating in the economy.
  - *Interest Rates:* Setting rates at which banks borrow from the central bank.
- **Purpose:** To control inflation, stabilize currency, and promote economic growth.
- **Effect of Money Supply:**
  - *Excess Money:* Can lead to inflation if demand outstrips supply.
  - *Inadequate Money:* May result in deflation and hinder economic activity.


### **Stimulating the Economy**

- Monetary policy tools:

  - Lowering discount rate.
  - Quantitative easing (buying treasuries).
  - Lowering bank reserve requirement.

**Additional Notes:**

- Leading indicators (stock prices, building permits) change before the economy.

- Coincident indicators (GDP) vary with the business cycle.

- Lagging indicators (unemployment rate) change after the economy.

- Exchange rates are determined by supply and demand for currencies.

- Purchasing power parity: Exchange rate where the same goods cost the same in different currencies.

- Strong USD benefits US importers and foreign exporters. Weak USD benefits US exporters and foreign importers.
