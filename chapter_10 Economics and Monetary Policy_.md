### **Business Cycle**

- Four phases:

  - Expansion: Economic growth, low unemployment.
  - Peak: Economy at its highest point.
  - Contraction/Recession: GDP decline, high unemployment.
  - Trough: Low point before recovery.

### **Inflation**

- Deflation: Cost of goods and services goes down.
- In deflation, outstanding bonds have higher coupons than new bonds due to potential interest rate reduction.

### **Yield Curve**

- Graphs interest rates vs. time to maturity.

- Normal: Upward slope, longer maturity = higher yield (riskier).

- Inverted: Short-term yields higher than long-term, indicates potential recession (investors seek safety in long-term treasuries).

### **Interest Rate Sensitivity**

- Growth stocks: Less sensitive, reinvest profits for future growth.

- Dividend-paying stocks: More sensitive, value competes with bond yields (utilities, REITs, preferreds).

### **Economic Policy Theories**

- Classical (Adam Smith): Minimal government intervention.

- Keynesian: Uses government spending/tax policy to influence economy.

- Monetarist (Federal Reserve): Uses money supply to affect economy.

### **Federal Reserve Tools**

- **Open market operations:** Buying/selling treasuries to inject/extract cash.

- **Reserve requirements:** Amount of cash banks must hold in reserve.

- **Discount rate:** Rate banks borrow from the Fed.

### **Interest Rates (low to high)**

- Fed funds rate (overnight bank-to-bank loans).

- Discount rate.

- Broker call rate (margin loans).

- Prime rate (best corporate customers).

### **Economic Cycle and Stocks**

- Cyclical stocks (auto, tech) perform well in expansions.

- Defensive stocks (utilities, consumer staples, healthcare) perform better in recessions.

- Recession: Two consecutive quarters of negative GDP growth.

### **Fiscal vs. Monetary Policy**
## Fiscal Policy:
- **Definition:** Involves government decisions regarding spending and taxation.
- **Components:** 
  - *Government Spending:* Allocation of funds towards various sectors like infrastructure, healthcare, education, etc.
  - *Taxation:* Determination of taxes levied on individuals and businesses.
- **Purpose:** To influence the economy by managing aggregate demand, employment levels, and economic growth.
- **Impact:** 
  - Increased government spending can stimulate demand and economic activity.
  - Tax cuts can incentivize spending and investment.
  - Conversely, tax hikes and reduced spending can curb inflationary pressures or reduce deficits.

## Monetary Policy:

- **Definition:** Involves managing the money supply and interest rates by a central bank.
- **Components:** 
  - *Money Supply:* Regulating the amount of money circulating in the economy.
  - *Interest Rates:* Setting rates at which banks borrow from the central bank.
- **Purpose:** To control inflation, stabilize currency, and promote economic growth.
- **Effect of Money Supply:**
  - *Excess Money:* Can lead to inflation if demand outstrips supply.
  - *Inadequate Money:* May result in deflation and hinder economic activity.


### **Stimulating the Economy**

- Monetary policy tools:

  - Lowering discount rate.
  - Quantitative easing (buying treasuries).
  - Lowering bank reserve requirement.

**Additional Notes:**

- Leading indicators (stock prices, building permits) change before the economy.

- Coincident indicators (GDP) vary with the business cycle.

- Lagging indicators (unemployment rate) change after the economy.

- Exchange rates are determined by supply and demand for currencies.

- Purchasing power parity: Exchange rate where the same goods cost the same in different currencies.

- Strong USD benefits US importers and foreign exporters. Weak USD benefits US exporters and foreign importers.
Stagflation is characterized by increasing
prices amid high unemployment in a
stagnant economy. Inflation is
characterized by increasing prices amid
an expanding economical period.

If the trade deficit is growing smaller, foreign buyers are buying more U.S. goods. This is because foreign currency has strengthened against the dollar. The value of the dollar against foreign currency and interest rates move in the same direction. So if the dollar is weakening, interest rates are falling, and bond prices are rising.

Counter-cyclical stocks are negatively correlated to the overall performance of the economy. In other words, they perform well when the economy is declining, and less well when the economy is strengthening. No correlation means that there is no relationship. Counter-cyclical stocks can be very effective in hedging other cyclical stocks against an economic decline as their price has a tendency to strengthen in a contracting economy.

The balance of payments is the money going out of a country versus the money flowing into a country. A favorable balance of payments is when the net balance of payments results in more
money coming into a country. The only transaction that results in money flowing into the U.S. is the Chinese government (or any foreign investor) buying securities in the United States
Foreign investors selling U.S. stocks and a U.S. corporation moving its headquarters both result in cash leaving the United States. U.S. taxpavers paving taxes to the U.S. government doesn't
**Deflation**
Deflation is considered a reduction in the general level of prices. Deflation leads to lower interest rates, which results in higher bond prices. Equities tend to perform well during periods of
inflation, not deflation.
