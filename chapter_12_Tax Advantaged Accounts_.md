**Lesson: Tax-Advantaged Accounts and Products**
This lesson covers different accounts that offer tax incentives for saving for retirement or education.

**Key Concepts**

- **Tax-Deferred vs. Tax-Free Growth:**
  - *Tax-deferred:* Contributions are deducted from current income, but earnings and withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income in the future (typically in retirement).
  - *Tax-free:* Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but earnings and qualified withdrawals are not taxed.

**Types of Accounts:**

**Retirement Plans:**
- **Qualified:** Meet ERISA guidelines and offer tax-deductible contributions.
- **Defined Benefit:** Employer promises a specific retirement benefit based on factors like salary and service.
- **Defined Contribution:** Employee and employer contributions determine retirement benefits based on investment performance.
- **Non-Qualified:** Don't meet ERISA guidelines and offer after-tax contributions, but earnings are tax-deferred.

**Education Plans:**
- **529 Plans:** Allow tax-free growth and withdrawals for qualified education expenses.
- **Coverdell Education Savings Accounts (ESAs):** Similar to 529 plans, but with lower contribution limits.
- **ABLE Accounts:** Allow tax-free growth and withdrawals for qualified disability expenses.
- **IRAs (Individual Retirement Accounts):** Allow tax-deductible contributions (Traditional IRAs) or after-tax contributions with tax-free qualified withdrawals (Roth IRAs).

**Lesson Outline**

**General Principles:**
