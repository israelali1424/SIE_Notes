# Lesson Four: Investment Companies

In this lesson, we'll dive into the world of investment companies. The goals include identifying different types of investment companies, understanding their characteristics, and exploring how mutual fund investors can reduce costs. We'll also discuss the market where these investment companies trade.

## Overview of Investment Companies

Investment companies were formed when Congress passed the Investment Company Act of 1940. The act aimed to create a formalized way for investors, especially retail investors, to pool their money into companies that would reinvest it to provide diversification, professional management, and liquidity.

### Types of Investment Companies

1. **Management Companies:**

   - **Open-End Funds (Mutual Funds):**

     - **Number of Shares:** Unlimited.
     - **Capitalization:** Continuous offering.
     - **Secondary Market:** No real secondary market; redemptions and purchases are made directly with the fund.
     - **Pricing:** Purchased at the public offer price (NAV + sales charge), sold at NAV.

   - **Closed-End Funds:**
     - **Number of Shares:** Fixed.
     - **Capitalization:** One-time IPO.
     - **Secondary Market:** Robust secondary market on exchanges or over the counter.
     - **Pricing:** Market-driven based on supply and demand or bid-ask spread.


### Net Asset Value (NAV) of a Mutual Fund

The Net Asset Value (NAV) of a mutual fund is calculated using the following steps:

1. **Total Value of Investment Holdings:** Add the total value of the fund's investment holdings.
2. **Subtract Fees and Expenses:** Subtract the fund's fees and expenses from the total value.
3. **Divide by Number of Shares:** Divide the resulting figure by the number of shares of the fund that investors currently own.

\[
\text{NAV} = \frac{\text{Total Value of Investment Holdings} - \text{Fees and Expenses}}{\text{Number of Shares}}
\]

2. **Unit Investment Trusts (UIT):**

   - A trust with a board of trustees.
   - Raises capital by selling units to investors.
   - Holds securities to achieve specific investment goals.

3. **Face Amount Certificate Entity:**
   - Type of investment company.
   - Not as favored due to loss of special tax characteristics.

### Purpose of Investment Companies

At the end of the day, investment companies pool money from investors and deploy it based on a specific investment goal.

### Open-End Funds (Mutual Funds) vs. Closed-End Funds

- **Number of Shares:**

  - Mutual Funds: Unlimited.
  - Closed-End Funds: Fixed.

- **Capitalization:**

  - Mutual Funds: Continuous offering.
  - Closed-End Funds: One-time IPO.

- **Secondary Market:**

  - Mutual Funds: No real secondary market; transactions with the fund.
  - Closed-End Funds: Robust secondary market on exchanges or over the counter.

- **Pricing:**
  - Mutual Funds: Purchased at the public offer price (NAV + sales charge), sold at NAV.
  - Closed-End Funds: Market-driven pricing based on supply and demand or bid-ask spread.

Mutual funds can invest in stocks, bonds, and the money market. They issue common stock to investors, who own shares of the mutual fund company. On the other hand, mutual funds may engage in pursuing a non-diversified investment objective, but they cannot sell securities short, buy securities on margin, or provide investment advice.
Overview of Investment Companies
Investment companies emerged following the passage of the Investment Company Act of 1940, a legislative effort to formalize a mechanism for investors, particularly retail ones, to pool their funds. The objective was to facilitate diversification, professional management, and liquidity.

Types of Investment Companies
Management Companies:

Open-End Funds (Mutual Funds):

Number of Shares: Unlimited.
Capitalization: Continuous offering.
Secondary Market: No real secondary market; transactions directly with the fund.
Pricing: Purchased at the public offer price (NAV + sales charge), sold at NAV.
Closed-End Funds:

Number of Shares: Fixed.
Capitalization: One-time IPO.
Secondary Market: Robust secondary market on exchanges or over the counter.
Pricing: Market-driven based on supply and demand or bid-ask spread.
Unit Investment Trusts (UIT):

A trust with a board of trustees.
Raises capital by selling units to investors.
Holds securities to achieve specific investment goals.
Face Amount Certificate Entity:

A type of investment company.
Less favored due to the loss of special tax characteristics.
Purpose of Investment Companies
At its core, investment companies gather funds from investors and deploy them according to specific investment objectives.

Management Companies
Open-End Funds (Mutual Funds) vs. Closed-End Funds
Number of Shares:

Mutual Funds: Unlimited.
Closed-End Funds: Fixed.
Capitalization:

Mutual Funds: Continuous offering.
Closed-End Funds: One-time IPO.
Secondary Market:

Mutual Funds: No real secondary market; transactions with the fund.
Closed-End Funds: Robust secondary market on exchanges or over the counter.

Closed-End Funds: Market-driven pricing based on supply and demand or bid-ask spread.
Mutual funds can invest in stocks, bonds, and the money market. They issue common stock to investors, who own shares of the mutual fund company. On the other hand, mutual funds may engage in pursuing a non-diversified investment objective, but they cannot sell securities short, buy securities on margin, or provide investment advice.

Mutual Fund Expenses
The primary ongoing cost for mutual fund investors is the expense ratio, distinct from the one-time sales charge. This ratio includes various components:

Management Fees: A significant portion covering the fund's portfolio manager's compensation, especially notable in actively managed funds.

12b-1 Fees: Allocated for marketing and shareholder services. The name stems from the legal code allowing these fees.

Other Expenses: Miscellaneous costs outside 12b-1 fees.
However, Rule 12b-1 under the Investment Company Act of 1940 allows mutual funds to use shareholder assets to cover distribution expenses. So, an organization using a 12b-1 plan essentially allows its mutual funds to tap into shareholder investments to pay for marketing, advertising, and other costs associated with selling the fund's shares.

The expense ratio is a crucial factor for investors, representing the annual cost for the fund's operations.

The value of mutual fund shares falls when the value of securities in the portfolios decreases and when the portfolio makes dividend or capital gains distributions. There is no change in NAV when new shares are issued or when shares are redeemed. In these situations new cash coming in is offset by new shares issued



Share Classes: A, B, and C
Class A Shares
Sales Charge: Upfront sales charge.
Breakpoints: Available for reduced sales charges, especially for larger investments.
12b-1 Fees: Typically lower.
Regulatory View: Favored for long-term ownership.
Class B Shares
Sales Charge: Back-end sales charge upon redemption.
Breakpoints: Not available.
Regulatory View: Generally considered less cost-effective for long-term ownership compared to Class A shares.
Class C Shares
Sales Charge: Level load assessed annually.
Breakpoints: Not available.
Regulatory View: Generally, Class A shares are prioritized for long-term ownership.
All share classes incur 12b-1 fees, with Class A shares often having the lowest. Regulators often advocate for Class A shares due to their cost-effectiveness for long-term investors.

Money Market Mutual Funds
Money market mutual funds have a distinctive characteristic:

Net Asset Value (NAV): The aim is to maintain a stable NAV of $1 per share. However, during economic fluctuations, the NAV may deviate, leading to a scenario termed "breaking the buck."
Understanding mutual fund expenses and share classes is crucial for investors navigating the intricacies of these investment vehicles. The next lesson will explore additional investment company securities, including investment trusts and closed-end funds.

Unit Investment Trusts (UITs)
A Unit Investment Trust (UIT) is distinct from mutual funds in its fixed portfolio approach. Once the trust purchases a portfolio, it remains static. UITs issue redeemable shares to investors, typically through a one-time public offering. Notably, there is no secondary market for these shares, and investors seeking redemption communicate directly with the UIT. Passive management prevails, often seen in fixed bond portfolios with a focus on specific areas, such as state-specific municipal bonds.

Portfolio Structure: Fixed and passive.
Share Issuance: Redeemable shares with no secondary market.
Management: Passive management or supervision.
Income Distribution: Dividends are distributed to investors, with no reinvestment. At maturity, remaining securities are liquidated and distributed.
Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs)
Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) share passive management traits with UITs but differ in their trading dynamics. ETFs trade on exchanges throughout the day, offering intraday liquidity. They typically track an index, sector, or commodity. Examples include VTI (Vanguard Total Index) and BND (Bond Market Fund).

Management: Primarily passive.
Trading: Intraday trading on exchanges.
Portfolio Exposure: Tracks an index, sector, or commodity.
Examples: VTI (Total Stock Market Index), BND (Bond Market Fund).
Reconstitution: When ETF portfolios are updated due to changes in the underlying index, it is termed "reconstitution."

Key Variables Associated with Investment Companies
| | Supervised (Passive Management) | Actively Managed | Redeemable Shares | Exchange-Traded |
|-------------------|----------------------------------|------------------|-------------------|-----------------|
| **Mutual Fund** | Yes | Yes | Yes | No |
| **Unit Investment Trust (UIT)** | Yes | No | Yes | No |
| **Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF)** | Yes | Yes | No | Yes |
| **Closed-End Fund** | No | Yes | No | Yes |

Trading at NAV: Redeemable shares must trade at Net Asset Value (NAV), while exchange-traded securities (ETFs and closed-end funds) can trade at prices different from NAV.

Conclusion
This lesson covered Unit Investment Trusts, Exchange-Traded Funds, and reinforced knowledge about investment companies. Key takeaways include understanding the unique features of UITs, the trading dynamics of ETFs, and the key variables differentiating investment vehicles. These insights are crucial for anyone navigating the complex landscape of investment products.

The maximum sales charge percentage
allowed is 8 ½%. To find the POP, divide
the NAV by 100% minus the sales
charge percentage. The NAV of $9.15 is
divided by 100% - 8 ½%. 9.15 divided by
.915 = $10. $1,000 divided by $10 POP
= 100 shares

1. **To calculate the percentage sales charge when given the NAV and the POP:**
Percentage Sales Charge = (POP - NAV) / POP * 100
Percentage Sales Charge = (POP / (POP - NAV)) * 100

Given:
- NAV = $9.50
- POP = $10.00

Percentage Sales Charge = (10 - 9.50) / 10 * 100
Percentage Sales Charge = (10 / (10 - 9.50)) * 100
                      = (0.50 / 10) * 100
                      = (100 / 50) * 100
                      = 0.05 * 100
                      = 5%

2. **To calculate the POP when given the NAV and the percentage sales charge:**
POP = NAV * (100% / (100% - Sales Charge))
POP = NAV * (100% / (100% - Sales Charge))

Given:
- NAV = $9.50
- Sales Charge = 5%

POP = 9.50 * (100% / (100% - 5%))
POP = 9.50 * (100% / 95%)
   = 9.50 * (100% / 95%)
   = 9.50 * (100 / 95)
   ≈ 10.00
