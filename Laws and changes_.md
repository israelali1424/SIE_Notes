The Investment Company Act of 1940
Regulates investment funds, including investment companies, investment advisers, and principal underwriters. The act's primary purpose is to protect investors by making them aware of the risks of buying and owning securities. One part of the act, 3C1, allows private investment companies to be exempt from certain regulations and reporting requirements.


The Investment Advisers Act of 1940
Regulates investment advisers. The act defines an adviser as someone who provides advice or makes recommendations on securities. Investment managers and advisers to private funds in the United States must register as investment advisers unless they are exempt from registration.

The Securities Exchange Act of 1934
Regulates securities exchanges, securities broker-dealers, transfer and clearing agents, and over-the-counter markets. The act and related statutes form the basis of regulation for financial markets and their participants in the United States.
