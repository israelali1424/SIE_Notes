- Holder ranking and types when a company goes bankrupt (i.e., secured, unsecured, general, etc.)
### Holder Ranking and Types When a Company Goes Bankrupt

**1. Secured Creditors:**
- **Definition:** Creditors who have a claim on specific assets of the company, which serve as collateral for the debt.
- **Examples:**
  - Mortgage lenders.
  - Equipment lenders.
- **Priority:** Secured creditors have the highest priority in bankruptcy proceedings. They are paid first from the proceeds of the collateral they hold.

**2. Unsecured Creditors:**
- **Definition:** Creditors who do not have any collateral backing their loans or claims. They rely solely on the company’s ability to pay.
- **Types:**
  - **General Unsecured Creditors:**
    - Includes trade creditors, suppliers, and other businesses owed money.
  - **Unsecured Bondholders:**
    - Bondholders who have no specific claim on assets.
- **Priority:** Unsecured creditors are paid after secured creditors have been satisfied. They are lower in the priority list and may receive only a portion of their claims or nothing at all.

**3. Subordinated (or Junior) Creditors:**
- **Definition:** Unsecured creditors with claims that are ranked below those of other unsecured creditors.
- **Examples:**
  - Subordinated debt holders.
  - Some types of bonds with junior ranking.
- **Priority:** Paid after all senior unsecured creditors have been satisfied. They are often paid only after significant recovery has been made for senior creditors.

**4. Preferred Shareholders:**
- **Definition:** Shareholders who hold preferred stock, which typically has priority over common stock in dividend payments and during liquidation.
- **Priority:** Preferred shareholders are paid after all creditors (secured and unsecured) but before common shareholders. They receive any remaining assets only after all debts have been paid.

**5. Common Shareholders:**
- **Definition:** Shareholders who own common stock and have residual claims on the company’s assets.
- **Priority:** Common shareholders are last in the priority list. They are paid only after all debts, preferred shareholders, and other claims have been satisfied. In many bankruptcies, common shareholders may receive little to no recovery.

Direct Participation Programs (DPPs)
- Umbrella term for businesses offering flow-through tax treatment (no corporate tax)
- Include limited partnerships (LPs) where investors are limited partners

- Types of voting shares for common stockholders, like statutory voting and cumulative voting

### Types of Voting Shares for Common Stockholders

**1. Statutory Voting:**
- **Definition:** Each shareholder has one vote per share for each director position up for election.
- **How It Works:**
  - If there are three director positions open and a shareholder owns 100 shares, they can cast 100 votes for each of the three positions.
  - This method allows shareholders to distribute their votes among the candidates as they see fit.
- **Impact:** 
  - Provides a more predictable voting outcome where larger shareholders have more influence.
  - May disadvantage minority shareholders, as they have less ability to elect a director of their choice.

**2. Cumulative Voting:**
- **Definition:** Shareholders can allocate all their votes to one candidate or distribute them among multiple candidates.
- **How It Works:**
  - If there are three director positions open and a shareholder owns 100 shares, they have 300 votes in total (100 shares × 3 positions).
  - Shareholders can use all 300 votes for a single candidate or divide them among multiple candidates.
- **Impact:**
  - Provides a way for minority shareholders to concentrate their votes on a particular candidate, increasing the chances of electing a representative.
  - Aims to enhance the representation of minority shareholders on the board of directors.

**Other Voting Rights and Types:**

- **One Share, One Vote:**
  - The standard voting system where each share represents one vote.
  - Most common for common stock.

- **Dual-Class Shares:**
  - Companies may issue multiple classes of shares with different voting rights.
  - Example: Class A shares might have 10 votes per share, while Class B shares might have only 1 vote per share.
  - Allows founders or insiders to retain control over the company despite holding a smaller percentage of equity.

- **Non-Voting Shares:**
  - Some shares do not carry voting rights.
  - Investors in these shares typically receive dividends but cannot vote on corporate matters.

### Study Tips:
- **Understand the Mechanisms:**
  - Know how statutory and cumulative voting work and how they affect shareholders' ability to influence corporate governance.
- **Recognize the Implications:**
  - Understand the impact of each voting method on minority and majority shareholders.
- **Identify Voting Rights:**
  - Be familiar with different types of shares and their associated voting rights, including common and non-voting shares.

By understanding these concepts, you'll be well-prepared to answer questions related to shareholder voting rights on the SIE exam.
