- SEC writes rules/interpretations based on these laws
- SEC delegates day-to-day oversight to SROs:
    - FINRA oversees broker-dealers, reps, exchanges, OTC markets
    - MSRB oversees municipal securities firms/professionals
- SEC focuses on big-picture goals like market fairness, integrity, structure

- Empowers SROs with enforcement/oversight responsibilities 
- FINRA/MSRB rules must be approved by SEC

**Registered Representative Registration Process**:

- To terminate association with a firm, file Form U5

**Key Points**:
- SIE + additional exam (not just SIE) required to be fully licensed rep

- Series exams (e.g. 7, 79) valid for 2 years before re-exam if not associated  
- Reps must update Form U4 within 30 days for outside business activities
- Reps must maintain updated residential address for 2 years after termination

**Reportable Events**:
- Short sale of mortgage negatively impacts rep's credit and must be reported

Trainings 
Firm Element Training:
Firm Element Training is a regulatory requirement mandated by FINRA for registered broker-dealer firms and their associated persons. It is designed to ensure that individuals working in the securities industry receive ongoing education and training on a wide range of topics relevant to their roles. The primary objective of Firm Element Training is to enhance the knowledge, skills, and professional competence of securities professionals to better serve clients and comply with regulatory requirements.

### Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC):
SEC oversees Finra 
- **Role**: The SEC is a federal agency responsible for regulating the securities industry, protecting investors, and maintaining fair and efficient markets.
- **Responsibilities**:
  - **Enforcement of Securities Laws**: The SEC enforces federal securities laws, including the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, to prevent fraud and ensure fair and transparent markets.

  - **Oversight of Investment Advisers and Mutual Funds**: The SEC regulates investment advisers, mutual funds, and other investment companies to protect investors and promote market integrity.
  - **Enforcement Actions**: The SEC investigates and takes enforcement actions against individuals and companies suspected of violating securities laws, imposing penalties and sanctions as necessary.

### Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA):
- **Role**: FINRA is a self-regulatory organization (SRO) authorized by Congress to regulate brokerage firms and registered securities representatives in the United States.
- **Responsibilities**:
  - **Licensing and Registration**: FINRA oversees the licensing and registration of brokerage firms and securities professionals, such as brokers and investment advisers.
  - **Rulemaking and Enforcement**: FINRA establishes rules and regulations governing the conduct of its member firms and their employees. It also investigates and takes disciplinary actions against individuals and firms for violations of FINRA rules and securities laws.
  - **Market Regulation**: FINRA operates regulatory programs to monitor trading activities in the securities markets, detect market manipulation and insider trading, and ensure compliance with securities regulations.
  - **Investor Education and Protection**: FINRA provides resources and educational materials to investors to help them make informed decisions and protect themselves from investment fraud and misconduct.

In summary, while both the SEC and FINRA play important roles in regulating the securities industry, the SEC is a government agency responsible for overall oversight and enforcement of federal securities laws, while FINRA is a self-regulatory organization focused on regulating brokerage firms and securities professionals through licensing, rulemaking, and enforcement activities.
