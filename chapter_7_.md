Suitability

Ensures investment recommendations align with a client's investment objectives and risk tolerance.
Fulfills a fiduciary duty to the client.
Prior to June 2020, suitability was the main standard.
Best Interest Test (Implemented in June 2020)

Raises the bar for suitability by requiring recommendations to be in the client's best interest, not just suitable.
Prevents brokers from prioritizing higher commissions over the client's financial well-being.
Investment Objectives

Growth: Aims for capital appreciation through stock investments (potentially lower dividends).
Income: Focuses on regular cash flow from investments like bonds or dividend-paying stocks.
Capital Preservation: Protects principal by investing in low-risk assets like cash equivalents (minimal returns).
Speculation: Seeks high potential returns with significant risk tolerance (often through options or aggressive investments).
Asset Allocation

Divides a portfolio across different asset classes like stocks, bonds, and cash equivalents.
Determines the overall risk profile of the portfolio.
A common rule of thumb allocates based on the investor's age (e.g., 100 minus age = percentage in stocks).
Diversification

Spreading investments across various sectors or asset classes within a category (e.g., different types of stocks).
Reduces portfolio risk by mitigating losses in one area with gains in another.
Return Calculations

Current Yield: Annual income (interest/dividends) divided by the current market price (expressed as a percentage).
Total Return: Combines all income (dividends/interest) and capital gains/losses over a period, divided by the initial investment (expressed as a percentage).
Understanding these concepts is crucial for the SIE exam. You should be able to:

Identify suitable investments for different objectives.
Explain the difference between asset allocation and diversification.
Calculate current yield and total return.
Recognize how the best interest test strengthens suitability standards.
