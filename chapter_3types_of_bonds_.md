**Module: Types of Bonds**

**I. Introduction:**

- Diverse landscape of bonds offering various features and risks.
- Investors choose bonds based on financial goals, risk tolerance, and market conditions.

**II. Categories of Bonds:**
**A. Government Bonds:** - Issued by governments to fund public projects. - Considered low-risk due to government backing. - Interest payment based on actual days and settles on T + 1.

**B. Corporate Bonds:** - Issued by corporations to raise capital. - Subject to credit risk; credit rating influences liquidity. - Accrues interest using 30-day months and 360-day years.

**C. Municipal Bonds:** - Issued by local governments for public projects. - Interest accrual similar to corporate bonds. - Varying levels of credit risk based on the municipality.

**D. Zero Coupon Bonds:** - No periodic interest payments; sold at a discount. - Trades "flat" as it doesn't accrue interest periodically. - Faces high volatility due to no coupon payments.

**E. High-Yield (Junk) Bonds:** - Issued by companies with lower credit ratings. - Higher risk and potential returns. - Liquidity may be lower due to higher credit risk.

**F. Convertible Bonds:** - Allows conversion to common stock at the bondholder's discretion. - Combines features of debt and equity. - Attractive for investors seeking potential equity participation.

**G. Floating Rate Bonds:** - Interest rates fluctuate based on benchmark rates. - Mitigates interest rate risk. - Suited for investors expecting interest rate changes.

**H. Mortgage-Backed Securities (MBS):** - Backed by a pool of mortgages. - Cash flows from mortgage payments support MBS. - Vulnerable to prepayment risk in changing interest rate environments.

**I. Callable Bonds:** - Issuers can redeem bonds before maturity. - Investors face call risk and potential reinvestment risk. - Callable feature benefits issuers in declining interest rate scenarios.

**III. Considerations for Investors:**

- Risk appetite, financial goals, and market conditions influence bond selection.

# Lesson: Basic Characteristics of Debt Securities

- Focus on bonds, covering owning bonds, return on bonds, interest rates, bond prices, and bond yields.
- Bonds symbolize formalized loans with a $1,000 par value, offering semiannual interest payments and par value repayment.

## II. Bond Characteristics and Pricing

- Common $1,000 par value; market value fluctuates based on interest rates.
- Coupon payments, paid semiannually, represent annual interest rate on the bond face amount.
- Example: A 10-year, $1,000 par value bond with a 6% coupon yields $30 per semiannual payment.

## III. Impact of Interest Rates on Bond Prices

- Bond prices move inversely to interest rates (interest rate risk).
- Duration measures sensitivity to rate changes; longer duration increases interest rate risk.
- Example: 30-year zero-coupon bonds appreciate most in falling interest rates.

## IV. Sensitivity to Interest Rate Risk

- Key factors: coupon and maturity.
- Low coupon and long maturity increase duration, raising interest rate risk.
- Bond prices adjust based on prevailing interest rates to maintain yields.

## V. Market Pricing of Bonds

- Bond prices change with prevailing interest rates.
- Examples: 3% coupon bond selling at a premium in a low-rate environment, selling at a discount in a high-rate environment.
- Investors may gain or lose based on trading price and maturity receipt.

## VI. Different Bond Yields

1. **Face yield:** Annual coupon rate on the bond face.
2. **Current yield:** Annual interest divided by market price, accounting for discount/premium.
3. **Yield to maturity:** Return if held until maturity, considering par value repayment.
4. **Yield to call:** Similar to yield to maturity, assuming early call by the issuer.

## VII. Market Dynamics in Bond Trading

- Bond prices influenced by interest rates; crucial to understand relationship with coupon rates.
- Investors strategically buy/sell bonds based on expected interest rate movements.

## IX. Investor Strategies in Changing Interest Rate Environments

- Investors adjust portfolios based on rate changes.
- In low-rate environments, seek higher coupon bonds; in rising-rate environments, prefer shorter-duration/higher coupon bonds.

## X. Summary of Key Points

- Bonds represent formalized loans with a specified par value.
- Bond prices fluctuate based on market factors, primarily prevailing interest rates.
- Interest rate risk is the inverse relationship between bond prices and interest rates.
- Different bond yields provide insights into potential returns.

## XI. Preparation for Market Dynamics

- Investors should understand bond pricing, market dynamics, and strategies based on interest rate expectations.
- Knowledge of bond yields aids in informed decision-making.

# Interest Rate Risk:

- Bond prices change with interest rates.
- Long-duration bonds (low coupon, long maturity) are most sensitive.
- Zero coupon bonds inherently have high volatility.
- Other risks: call risk, reinvestment rate risk, and inflation risk.

# Credit Risk:

- The risk of default, where an issuer may fail to make interest payments or repay principal.
- Credit rating and liquidity: Good credit bonds have higher liquidity; bad credit bonds face low liquidity.
- Downgrades increase credit risk, affecting marketability.

# III. Application of Risks in Scenarios

## Inflation Risk (Purchasing Power Risk):

- Fixed income doesn't adjust with rising costs.
- Test point: Fixed income portfolio and declining purchasing power over time.

## Lower Coupon Bonds in the Market:

- Call risk and reinvestment risk.
- Bond issuers may call expensive bonds in a declining rate environment.

## Higher Coupon Bonds in the Market:

- Interest rate risk.
- Bond prices decrease when new bonds offer higher coupons, causing potential losses.

## Issuer Downgraded (Credit Risk):

- Reduction in credit rating, increased credit risk.
- Liquidity risk in low-rated bonds due to reduced market interest.

# IV. Accrued Interest:

- Earned but unreceived interest owed to a bondholder.
- Calculation based on 30-day months and 360-day years for corporate and municipal bonds.
- Government bonds use actual days and settle on a T + 1 cycle.

## V. Accrued Interest Calculation Example

- Illustration of accrued interest calculation.
- Monthly breakdown counting 30 days in each month.
- Importance of T + 1 settlement in determining accrued interest ownership.

## VI. Accrued Interest Related Questions

- Days of Accrued Interest Calculation:

  - Demonstrating understanding of counting days for accrued interest.
  - Application of conventions related to accrued interest.

- Taxation of Accrued Interest:

  - Accrued interest received is taxable as ordinary income.
  - Clarification that accrued interest does not impact the bond's cost basis.

- Bond Trading "Flat" Description:
  - A bond without accrued interest is described as trading "flat."
  - Example: Zero coupon bonds trade flat due to no interest earned and paid periodically.

#TIPs
Treasury Inflation Protected Securities (TIPS)

Unlike other Treasury securities, where the principal is fixed, the principal of a TIPS can go up or down over its term.

When the TIPS matures, if the principal is higher than the original amount, you get the increased amount. If the principal is equal to or lower than the original amount, you get the original amount.

An investor should expect the greatest price increase in which of the following if interest rates decline?
Long term bonds selling at discount
Because of the inverse relationship between price and yield, when interest rates fall, bond prices rise. Longer maturities have more market risk, so their prices rise more than shorter maturities. Bonds selling at a discount also rise more sharply than those selling at a premium.

# convertaibe bonds

The conversion price is the price at which a convertible bond can be converted into shares of the company's stock. This is calculated as par value of the bond divided by the conversion ratio. A convertible bond's conversion price will be defined in the offering memorandum and the indenture. The conversion premium is the spread between the market price of the convertible bond and the price at which it can be converted, expressed as a percentage. The conversion ratio is the number of shares of stock that can be exchanged for each bond. This is calculated as the par value of the bond divided by the conversion price. The conversion value is the current value of the bond if it is was converted today.

New issues of Treasury securities can
be sold only after the SEC has received
their registration statement
U.S. government securities are exempt
from registration statement and
prospectus requirements required by the
Securities Act of 1933. New issues of
Treasury securities are sold through
auctions conducted by the Federal
Reserve Board. The rates of newly
issued T-bills are often used to establish
interest rates for variable rate securities
and mortgage loans.

Government bonds and notes are
quoted as a percentage of par in
1/32nds. 
Government bills are quoted on
a discounted yield basis.

**Senior Secured Debt**
Definition: Debt that is backed by specific collateral, such as property, equipment, or other tangible assets. In the event of default, lenders have a legal claim to the collateral.
**Examples:**

  Mortgages: Loans secured by real estate.
  Equipment Loans: Loans secured by machinery or equipment.
  Secured Bonds: Bonds backed by specific assets of the issuing company.

**Unsecured Senior Debt**
Definition: Debt that is not backed by any specific collateral. In the event of default, unsecured lenders have a general claim on the company's assets, but they are not prioritized over secured debt holders.
**Examples:**
  Senior Unsecured Bonds: Bonds not backed by specific assets.
  Revolving Credit Facilities: Lines of credit extended to a company without specific collateral.
  Term Loans: Unsecured loans with a set repayment schedule.


  A debenture is the common term for an unsecured debt instrument of a corporation or bank. It's main backing comes from the credit worthiness of the issue


  The conversion price is the price at which a convertible bond can be converted into shares of the company's stock. The conversion price is set at the time the bond is issued. The conversion ratio equals par value / conversion price. The conversion value is the current value of the bond if it is was converted today. The conversion premium is calculated as the spread between the market price of the convertible bond and the price at which it can be converted, expressed as a percentage.
