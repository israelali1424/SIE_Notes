**Key Points**:

- **Issuer Requirements**: Must comply with the laws of the country where the offering is made.
- **Investor Requirements**: Securities must be sold to non-U.S. persons.

- **Issuer Requirements**: No issuer requirements, but securities must be sold initially to QIBs.
- **Resale Restrictions**: Allows QIBs to resell the securities among themselves without registering with the SEC.

Understanding these various regulations and offering methods helps companies choose the most suitable approach to raising capital while ensuring compliance with legal requirements. Investors also benefit by understanding the risks and opportunities associated with each type of offering.

Rule 144 allows public resale of restricted and control securities if a number of conditions are met. Restricted securities are those securities that have been acquired through a private placement or other exempt transaction (i.e. Regulation S for overseas offerings), and are not registered. Control securities are those held by an affiliate of the issuing company. An affiliate is a person, such as a director or large shareholder, in a relationship of control with the issuer. Control securities are not always subject to a holding period. They must satisfy a holding period only if they are also restricted. Securities acquired by non-affiliates through an open market transaction are neither restricted nor control stock, and are not subject to Rule 144.

The registration statement and prospectus contain the most important disclosures that are required of publicly offered securities under the '33 Act. Prior to the offering, the SEC will review the registration and preliminary prospectus for completeness, and it may request amendments or additions in these documents, before the offering can proceed. Recall, however, the SEC never actually approves or disapproves of the actual securities.

An offering memorandum is a disclosure document usually provided for exempt transactions, such as Regulation D or Regulation A offerings.
