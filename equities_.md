Here are even more in-depth notes on SIE Equities:

**Dividends**

- Cash payment of profits to shareholders
- Important dates:
  - Declaration date - dividend amount announced
  - Ex-dividend date - first date share trades without dividend
  - Record date - must own by this date to receive dividend 
  - Payment date - dividend paid out

- Broker lends shares to short seller to deliver to buyer 
- Short seller receives cash proceeds but has obligation to return shares
- Must eventually buy back shares to return to lender and close short position
- Potential for unlimited losses if stock rises
