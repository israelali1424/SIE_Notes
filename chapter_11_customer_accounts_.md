**Key Points:**

- **Marginable Securities:** Securities that can be purchased on margin (e.g., stocks listed on major exchanges, some ETFs).
- **Non-Marginable Securities:** Securities that cannot be purchased on margin (e.g., most options contracts, new issues of securities).

**Initial Margin:**

- Reg T requires a 50% initial margin (customer puts up 50%, broker loans 50%).
- FINRA requires a minimum of $2,000 initial margin for most purchases exceeding $2,000 (overrides Reg T in such cases).
- For purchases under $2,000, 100% initial margin is required (customer pays entire amount).

**Maintenance Margin:**

- Equity in the account must be at least a certain percentage of the current market value to avoid a margin call.
- Long position maintenance margin: 25% of the current market value.
- Short position maintenance margin: 30% of the current market value (higher due to higher risk).

- Customer can begin trading after approval (step 3) but must eventually return the agreement.
- Failure to return the agreement limits trading to closing transactions only.

**Discretionary Accounts and Account Titles/Types:**

**Discretionary Accounts:**
- Customer gives trading authorization to registered rep via power of attorney.
- Allows rep to execute trades (asset, amount, buy/sell) without client's explicit approval.
- Provides flexibility for rep to act on opportunities promptly.
- Raises risk of churning (excessive trading) by rep to generate commissions.

**Trading Authority Without Discretion:**
- Reps can decide price and time of execution for "not held" orders, but not asset/amount/action.

- Fee-based accounts least appropriate for buy-and-hold investors.
- Client responsible for fees/charges on discretionary trades placed by rep.

- Coverage determined by account title (individual, joint, IRA are separate).

A simple trust distributes all of its income to its beneficiaries in the year it is earned. 
 A complex trust does not necessarily distribute all of its earned income to its beneficiaries. 
 A charitable trust is for individuals who want to leave part or all of their estate to charity. 
A revocable trust can be revoked (eliminated) at any time prior to death by the person who owns the assets (the trustor).


A fee-based account would be
appropriate for an investor who will place
a large number of trades. An investor
placing a small number of trades would
likely have a commission based account.
**Markdown and Markups

Principal (dealer) transactions involve financial professionals and their firms performing transactions directly with their clients in return for markups and markdowns. When a purchase order is submitted by a client, the firm sells the security to the client from their own inventory at a "marked up" price. When a sale order is submitted by a client, the firm buys the security at a "marked down" price and places it into their inventory.

Commissions are charged for agency (broker) transactions, while sales loads are assessed on mutual fund transactions.
