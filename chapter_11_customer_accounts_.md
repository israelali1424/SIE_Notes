**Initial Margin:**

- Reg T requires a 50% initial margin (customer puts up 50%, broker loans 50%).

- For purchases under $2,000, 100% initial margin is required (customer pays entire amount).

**Maintenance Margin:**

- Equity in the account must be at least a certain percentage of the current market value to avoid a margin call.
- Long position maintenance margin: 25% of the current market value.
- Short position maintenance margin: 30% of the current market value (higher due to higher risk).

**Discretionary Accounts and Account Titles/Types:**

**Discretionary Accounts:**

- Customer gives trading authorization to registered rep via power of attorney.
- Allows rep to execute trades (asset, amount, buy/sell) without client's explicit approval.
- Provides flexibility for rep to act on opportunities promptly.
- Raises risk of churning (excessive trading) by rep to generate commissions.

**Trading Authority Without Discretion:**

- Reps can decide price and time of execution for "not held" orders, but not asset/amount/action.

- Coverage determined by account title (individual, joint, IRA are separate).
- Does not cover investment losses, fraud, non-securities.
- Contrast with FDIC deposit insurance backed by U.S. government.

A simple trust distributes all of its income to its beneficiaries in the year it is earned.
A complex trust does not necessarily distribute all of its earned income to its beneficiaries.
A charitable trust is for individuals who want to leave part or all of their estate to charity.
A revocable trust can be revoked (eliminated) at any time prior to death by the person who owns the assets (the trustor).

A fee-based account would be
appropriate for an investor who will place
a large number of trades. An investor
placing a small number of trades would
likely have a commission based account.
\*\*Markdown and Markups


# Factors in Determining a Fair Markup or Commission

Among the relevant factors that a member may consider in determining a fair markup or commission are the following:

- **The type of security involved**
  - Common stock would normally demand a higher markup than debt.
- **The availability of the security in the market**
  - Whether it is actively or inactively traded.
- **The price of the security**
- **The amount of money involved in the transaction**
- **Disclosure**
  - Made prior to the execution of the transaction may be relevant.
- **The pattern of markups**
- **The nature of the member firm's business**
  - What type of services does the member provide to the customer?

**Note:** The type of client is not specifically mentioned in the rules as determining whether the markup or commission is fair and reasonable.


Principal (dealer) transactions involve financial professionals and their firms performing transactions directly with their clients in return for markups and markdowns. When a purchase order is submitted by a client, the firm sells the security to the client from their own inventory at a "marked up" price. When a sale order is submitted by a client, the firm buys the security at a "marked down" price and places it into their inventory.

Commissions are charged for agency (broker) transactions, while sales loads are assessed on mutual fund transactions.

Interest charges in a margin account are usually based on the broker call rate.
This is the rate of interest at which a broker-dealer would borrow funds from a
bank in order to make a loan to one of its margin customers.

**"Transfer at death"**
refers to the methods and legal mechanisms by which a person's assets are passed on to beneficiaries or heirs upon their death. There are several ways that assets can be transferred at death, each with its own legal implications and processes:

1. **Will**:

   - A legal document in which a person (testator) specifies how their assets should be distributed after their death.
   - A will must go through probate, a court-supervised process to authenticate the will and oversee the distribution of assets.

2. **Trusts**:

   - A trust is a legal arrangement where one party (trustee) holds and manages assets for the benefit of another (beneficiary).
   - A living trust can avoid probate, allowing assets to be transferred directly to beneficiaries according to the terms of the trust.

3. **Joint Tenancy with Right of Survivorship**:

   - Property owned jointly by two or more individuals, where upon the death of one owner, the property automatically transfers to the surviving owner(s).
   - Common for real estate and bank accounts.

4. **Beneficiary Designations**:

   - Certain assets allow the owner to name a beneficiary who will receive the asset directly upon the owner's death.
   - Examples include life insurance policies, retirement accounts (such as IRAs and 401(k)s), and payable-on-death (POD) bank accounts.

5. **Transfer on Death (TOD) Accounts**:

   - Financial accounts or securities that allow the owner to designate a beneficiary who will receive the assets directly upon the owner's death.
   - This designation can usually be made with a simple form provided by the financial institution.

6. **Payable on Death (POD) Accounts**:

   - Similar to TOD accounts, these are bank accounts that allow the owner to name a beneficiary to receive the funds in the account upon the owner's death.

7. **Community Property with Right of Survivorship**:

   - In some states, married couples can own property as community property with right of survivorship.
   - Upon the death of one spouse, the property automatically transfers to the surviving spouse without going through probate.

8. **Life Estate**:
   - A form of property ownership where one person (life tenant) has the right to use the property during their lifetime, and upon their death, the property passes to another person (remainderman) without going through probate.

Each method has its own advantages, disadvantages, and legal requirements. Consulting with an estate planning attorney can help individuals choose the best options for their specific circumstances and ensure that their assets are distributed according to their wishes.


**Margin Account Notes**

The margin account disclosure document is required at or prior to account approval and annually thereafter. These disclosures must include the following:

- You can lose more funds than you deposit in the margin account.
- The firm can force the sale of securities or other assets in your account(s).
- The firm can sell your securities or other assets without contacting you.
- You are not entitled to choose which securities or other assets in your account(s) are liquidated or sold to meet a margin call.
- The firm can increase its "house" maintenance margin requirements at any time and is not required to provide you advance written notice.
- You are not entitled to an extension of time on a margin call.



The rules of settlement that apply to corporate securities in a cash account are regular way settlement of T + 1 and payment is required two business days later (T + 3). Failure to pay by T + 3 results in the firm selling out the customer's securities and freezing the account. 

As of May 28, 2024, the standard settlement cycle for securities transactions will be shortened from two business days after the trade (T+2) to one business day after the trade (T+1). 

For more information on the new rule and its implications, please refer to the “T+1 Settlement Addendum” in the supplements section of the Knopman.com Training Center.


Trade Conformation 
The confirmation is not required to disclose the identity of the SROs that regulate the firm. It must, however, disclose potential conflicts of interest, such as whether the firm makes market in the security, receives payment for order flow, or is in a control relationship with the issuer.
