  limited partnerships
  The investing of partnership assets is a role of the general partner. A limited partner that attempts to take this responsibility is no longer a passive investor. In this case, the limited partner becomes fully liable for the debts of the partnership like the general partners. Limited partners are permitted to inspect the books and records, sue the GP, receive a share of partnership distributions, and take on a proportionate share of the recourse debt of the partnership.
