## Lesson Number Nine: The Secondary Market

**Speaker Notes:**
In this lesson, we will discuss what happens to securities after they are issued and sold to the public for the first time. We will describe the secondary market and the purpose and operation of stock exchanges. We will compare the New York Stock Exchange to Nasdaq. We will talk about securities that are not listed on our exchanges but instead trade over-the-counter. We will look at how securities are quoted on these exchanges and over-the-counter venues. We will define the bid and the ask and the requirements associated with each. We will also discuss the different order types that customers can use to achieve particular investment goals, such as market orders, limit orders, and stop orders. Finally, we will review some of the key rules that govern and regulate participants in the secondary market.

## The Role of the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934

- **Securities Act of 1933:**
  - Governs the initial sale of securities to the public.
- **Securities Exchange Act of 1934:**
  - Governs the trading of securities on exchanges and over-the-counter markets.
- **Broker-Dealers:**
  - Act as brokers or dealers.
  - **Broker:**
    - Matches buyers and sellers and charges a commission.
  - **Dealer:**
    - Buys and sells securities for their own account, marking up or down the prices.

**Speaker Notes:**
The Securities Act of 1933 is the first federal law to regulate the sale of securities to the public. It requires that companies register their securities with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) before they can be sold to the public. The Securities Exchange Act of 1934 governs the trading of securities on exchanges and over-the-counter markets. It requires that broker-dealers register with the SEC and that they comply with certain rules and regulations. Broker-dealers can act as brokers or dealers. As a broker, a broker-dealer matches buyers and sellers of securities and charges a commission for their services. As a dealer, a broker-dealer buys and sells securities for their own account and marks up the price of securities they sell and marks down the price of securities they buy.

## Market Makers

- **Market Makers:**
  - Stand ready to buy and sell a particular stock regularly.
  - Must post bid and ask prices.
  - **Spread:** Difference between bid and ask price.
  - **Inside Market:** Highest bid and lowest ask price.

**Speaker Notes:**
Market makers are firms that stand ready to buy and sell a particular stock on a regular and continuous basis at a publicly quoted price. They help to ensure that there is always a buyer and a seller for a stock, which helps to improve the liquidity of the stock. Market makers must post two-sided quotes, which means they must quote a price at which they are willing to buy the stock (bid) and a price at which they are willing to sell the stock (ask). The spread is the difference between the bid price and the ask price. The inside market is the highest bid price and the lowest ask price.


- **Limit Order Book:**
  - Display of buy and sell orders for a stock.
  - Market makers and investors can post orders.
- **Buy Order:**
  - Order to buy at a specific price or lower.
- **Sell Order:**
  - Order to sell at a specific price or higher.

**Speaker Notes:**
The limit order book is a display of all the buy and sell orders for a particular stock at a given time. Market makers and other investors can post orders to the limit order book. A buy order is an order to buy a stock at a specific price or lower. For example, a buy order to buy 100 shares of Apple at 100 per share  means that the investor is willing to pay up to $100 per share for 100 shares of Apple. A sell order is an order to sell a stock at a specific price or higher. For example, a sell order to sell 100 shares of Apple at $105 per share means that the investor is willing to sell 100 shares of Apple for at least $105 per share.
**Market Orders:**
- Used to buy or sell a security immediately at the best available price.
- Executes at the prevailing market price without regard to a specific price.
- Guarantees execution but not price.

**Limit Orders:**
- Specify a price at which an investor is willing to buy or sell a security.
- Execution occurs only at the specified price or a better price.
- Provides price control but not execution certainty.

**Stop Orders:**
- Trigger a market order when a certain price (stop price) is reached.
- Buy stop orders are used to buy a security if the price rises above the stop price.
- Sell stop orders are used to sell a security if the price falls below the stop price.
- Converts to a market order once the stop price is reached.

**Other Covered Topics:**
- Order execution and settlement processes.
- Violations such as front running and market manipulation.

## I. Buy Limit Order
A buy limit order is an order to purchase a security at or below a specified price. This type of order ensures that the investor does not pay more than the pre-set price for the stock. For example, if you want to buy a stock that is currently trading at $50, you might set a buy limit order at $48. If the stock price falls to $48 or lower, the order will be executed; if not, it will not be executed.

## II. Buy Stop Order
A buy stop order is an order to purchase a security at a price above the current market price, triggered when the market price reaches the stop price. This is often used to limit losses or protect profits on a short sale. For example, if a stock is currently trading at $40 and you place a buy stop order at $45, your order will become a market order when the stock reaches $45, potentially buying at the next available price.

## III. Open Sell Stop Order
An open sell stop order (also known simply as a sell stop order) is an order to sell a security once its price drops to a specified stop price. Once the stop price is reached, the sell stop order becomes a market order. This type of order is typically used to limit losses on a long position. For example, if you own a stock currently trading at $60 and you set a sell stop order at $55, your order will be triggered if the stock price drops to $55, and the stock will be sold at the next available price.

## IV. Sell Limit Order
A sell limit order is an order to sell a security at or above a specified price. This type of order ensures that the investor does not sell the stock for less than the set price. For instance, if you own a stock trading at $50, you might set a sell limit order at $52. If the stock price rises to $52 or higher, the order will be executed; if not, it will not be executed.

## Ex-Dividend Date Impact
On the ex-dividend date, the price of a stock typically drops by the amount of the dividend, as new buyers will not receive the declared dividend. Some orders are automatically reduced to reflect this change to avoid unintended transactions.

## Orders Not Reduced on the Ex-Dividend Date
All orders placed below the market are adjusted downward on the ex-dividend date by the amount of the dividend. Orders placed below the market are buy limits, sell stops, and sell stop limits. Sell limits, buy stops and buy stop limits are not adjusted on the ex-dividend dat

### Reduced on the Ex-Dividend Date Explanation

When a company declares a dividend, the stock price typically drops by the amount of the dividend on the ex-dividend date. This happens because new buyers of the stock are not entitled to the declared dividend. To account for this drop in price, certain types of orders may be automatically adjusted. This adjustment is done to avoid scenarios where orders might be executed unintentionally due to the price change caused by the dividend distribution.

### Example Scenario

Let's consider Henry's GTC (Good 'Til Canceled) limit order:

- **Order Details**: Henry has placed a GTC limit order to buy 200 shares of AT&T at $30.50 or better.
- **Dividend Declared**: AT&T declares a quarterly dividend of $0.45 per share.

### Adjusting the Limit Price

Since the ex-dividend date causes the stock price to drop by the amount of the dividend ($0.45 in this case), Henry's limit order to buy 200 shares of AT&T at $30.50 will be adjusted downwards to reflect this change.

### Calculation

1. **Original Limit Price**: $30.50
2. **Dividend Amount**: $0.45

To adjust the limit price, we subtract the dividend amount from the original limit price:

\[ \text{Adjusted Limit Price} = \text{Original Limit Price} - \text{Dividend Amount} \]

\[ \text{Adjusted Limit Price} = \$30.50 - \$0.45 = \$30.05 \]

### Answer

On the ex-dividend date, Henry's limit price will be **$30.05**.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

- **$30.05**

The options provided and their analysis:

- **$30.05**: Correct, as explained above.
- **$30.50**: Incorrect, this is the original limit price before adjustment.
- **$30.95**: Incorrect, this is not relevant to the dividend adjustment scenario.
- **Orders are cancelled when a dividend for more than $0.25 is declared**: This is not typically correct unless specified by the brokerage or specific order terms.
