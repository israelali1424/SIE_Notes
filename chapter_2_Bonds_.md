VII. Bond Yields

1. **Face Yield:** Stated on the face of the bond, fixed and doesn't change.
2. **Current Yield:** Annual interest divided by the current market price, varies for discount or premium bonds.
3. **Yield to Maturity:** Return if held until maturity, affected by buying at discount or premium.
4. **Yield to Call:** Similar to yield to maturity but assumes the bond is called, influencing the timing of returns.

**Coupon Yield:**

- Fixed coupon on the face of the bond.

**Current Yield:**

- Annual interest divided by the current market value.

**Yield to Maturity:**

- Return if held until maturity, including gain or loss.

**Yield to Call:**

- Return if the bond is called before maturity.

### Sequence of yields on a discount bond:

1. **Nominal Yield (Coupon):** Indicated by terms like "coupon" or the bond's rate.
2. **Current Yield:** Calculated as annual interest over the current market price.
3. **Yield to Maturity:** Often indicated by ING verbs like trading or yielding.
4. **Yield to Call:** Highest return due to getting the principal back sooner.

### Premium bond yields:

- Nominal yield is highest, followed by subsequent yields getting lower.
- Current yield is below nominal due to paying more than par value.
- Yield to maturity is even lower, reflecting the loss from paying above par.

**Effect of trading at par:**

- Nominal, current, and yield to maturity are equal when a bond trades at par.

### Bond Quotes and Calculations:

- Bonds quoted as a percentage of par value.
  - Example: A quote of 90 means the bond costs $900.

#### Calculating current yield:

- Current Yield = (Annual Interest / Current Market Price) \* 100.
  - Example: A quote of 90 results in a current yield of 8.9%, better than the coupon.

### Zero Coupon Bonds:

- Example: $1,000 par value zero coupon bond bought for $350.
  - Quote would be 35.
- No annual interest, profit at maturity is the difference between buying and par value.
- Investment objectives include long-term goals like retirement or education savings.

**Risks of Zero Coupon Bonds:**

- Higher interest rate risk due to low coupons.
- Potential phantom income and tax on annual accretion.

### Callable Bonds and Additional Features:

1. **Callable Bonds:**

   - Issuer can redeem the bond early.
   - Call protection period prevents early redemption.

2. **Put Feature:**

   - Investor can demand early repayment, typically triggered by specific events.

3. **Convertible Bonds:**
   - Investor can convert bonds into shares of common stock.
     Parity is found by dividing the current bond price by the conversion ratio at par value. Therefore, $1,000/$40 = 25. A ratio of 25 means that for each bond equates to 25 shares of common stock. So divide $1,350 by 25 and you get $54 per share.

**Lesson 2: Overview of Bond Risks**

I. **Interest Rate Risk**

- **Definition:** Risk associated with changes in bond prices as interest rates fluctuate.
- **Sensitivity:** Bonds with longest duration, low coupon, or both are most sensitive.
- **Special Case:** Zero coupon bonds inherently have high volatility and interest rate risk.

II. **Other Risks Associated with Bonds**

1. **Call Risk:**

   - Concerns bond issuer calling back expensive bonds due to falling interest rates.

2. **Reinvestment Risk:**

   - Associated with reinvesting coupons at lower rates if bonds are not called.

3. **Inflation Risk:**
   - Also known as purchasing power risk, reflects decreasing real income over time.

III. **Credit Risk**

- **Definition:** Risk of default; issuer unable to make promised interest payments or repay principal.
- **Analysis:** Credit rating agencies evaluate credit risk.
- **Liquidity Impact:** Bonds with good credit have more liquidity; those with bad credit face liquidity issues.
- **Junk Status:** Deteriorating credit leads to reduced liquidity as institutional investors avoid these bonds.

IV. **Application Scenarios for Risks**

- **Inflation Risk:**
  - Fixed income portfolios face declining real purchasing power over time.
- **Call and Reinvestment Risk:**

  - Concerns arise when new bonds with lower coupons are issued due to falling interest rates.

- **Interest Rate Risk:**

  - Bond prices drop when new bonds with higher coupons emerge as rates rise.

- **Credit Risk:**
  - Business difficulties leading to downgrade increase credit risk, associated with liquidity risk.

V. **Accrued Interest**

- **Definition:** Earned but unreceived interest owed to a bond holder.
- **Calculation:** Corporate and muni bonds use 30-day month, 360-day year; government bonds use actual days.
- **Settlement Cycle:** Government bonds settle on T + 1 cycle.
- **Illustration:** Accrued interest splits between buyer and seller during bond transfer.
- **Taxation:** Accrued interest is taxable as ordinary income, doesnâ€™t impact bond's cost basis.
- **Flat Bond:** A bond with no accrued interest, e.g., zero coupon bonds.

[End of Notes]

In general, yield spreads increase during periods of recession and decrease during periods of expansion. When the spread is wide between bonds of different quality ratings, investors can conclude that the market is factoring more risk of default on the lower grade bonds, which implies that the economy is slowing down. The increased spread indicates that the market is predicting a greater risk of default.

**Call Risk**

Call risk refers to the risk associated with callable bonds or callable securities. Callable bonds give the issuer the right to redeem or "call" the bonds before their maturity date. When interest rates decline, issuers are more likely to exercise their right to call the bonds and refinance them at lower rates. This exposes bondholders to call risk because they may receive their principal back earlier than expected, potentially leading to reinvestment at lower interest rates. As a result, investors in callable bonds face the risk of having their expected cash flows disrupted or their investment strategies impacted by early redemption.

**Dates Associated with Dividend Payments:**

- **Declaration Date:** This is the date on which a company's board of directors announces its intention to pay a dividend. Once declared, the dividend becomes a liability on the company's balance sheet.

- **Ex-Dividend Date:** The ex-dividend date, or ex-date, is the date on which the stock begins trading without the dividend. In other words, if you buy the stock on or after the ex-dividend date, you will not receive the upcoming dividend payment. The ex-dividend date is typically set two business days before the record date.

- **Record Date:** The record date, also known as the date of record, is the date on which a shareholder must be on the company's books to receive the dividend. Investors who own shares of the stock on or before the record date are eligible to receive the dividend.

- **Payment Date:** This is the date on which the dividend is actually paid to eligible shareholders. It is usually a few weeks after the record date. Shareholders receive their dividend payments through checks mailed to their registered addresses or through direct deposit into their brokerage accounts.

**Convertible bonds**
The conversion price is the price at which a convertible bond can be converted into shares of the company's stock. The conversion price is set at the time the bond is issued. The conversion ratio equals par value / conversion price. The conversion value is the current value of the bond if it is was converted today. The conversion premium is calculated as the spread between the market price of the convertible bond and the price at which it can be converted, expressed as a percentage.

When trading at a discount the lowest yield of a bond is the nominal yield (i.e. coupon), followed by the current yield, the yield to maturity, and the yield to call. You may want to note that the yield-to-worst is always the lower of the yield to maturity or yield to call.

Tax anticipation notes (TANs) are short term municipal instruments that are issued in anticipation of an upcoming tax collection. Schools are supported by property taxes, so TANs can be used to provide interim financing until the tax revenue is available.

Income tax is only on interest income
earned on U.S. government bonds at the
federal level.

Treasury bonds trade with accrued interest using actual day months, a 365- day year, and settle T+1. If the trade settles on Feb 24th and interest is paid
every January 1st and July 1st, the number of days of accrued interest between January 1st:
January ? 31 days
February ? 23 days
54 days

Bonds that are retired through a sinking fund have less default risk, because the issuer is making payments in advance to a trustee to buy bonds in the open market. This reduction of principal risk allows the issuer to offer these bonds at a lower interest rate.

Accretion
The increase in value of a bond that was purchased at a discount, or less than its face value, as it approaches maturity. Accretion can also refer to the growth in earnings and assets after a merger or acquisition.
Amortization
The decrease in value of a bond that was purchased at a premium, or more than its face value, as it approaches maturity. Amortization can also refer to the accounting technique used to depreciate intangible assets, such as patents, trademarks, and loans, over their estimated useful life
